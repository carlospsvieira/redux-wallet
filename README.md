# Redux Wallet (Budget List and Currency Converter)

##### Intro:
This is my first Redux project, it's a budget list that converts other currencies to Brazilian Real (BRL)
Global states are a very relevant part of any application, and learning how to work with Redux made it much easier.

#### Technologies:
- Redux + React
- CSS (no framework)

#### Project Requests:
- Class components with global state using Redux
- Add and remove activities and display total price at the top corner right
